In order to improve my music theory skills, I decided to code a music theory question generator.

*Features:*
- music theory engine
- different types of questions: scale notes, scale formula, scale harmonization, recognize a scale, interval between notes, chords...
- HTTP API to generate questions

*Ideas:*
- front-end
- ear training
- support for instruments (guitar, piano)
