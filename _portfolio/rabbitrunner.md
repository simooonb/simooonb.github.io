In engineering school, we were asked to make a Unity game in three days. This is what we came up with.

In RabbitRunner, you control a cube and you are thrown into a tube, at an ever increasing speed. The goal is to survive the longest.
Colored barriers will recognize and block you if you are the same color as them. If you are of a different color, and you pass through them, you will be change color.
