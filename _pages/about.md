I am a __Operations Research Software Engineer__ working at Colisweb in Lille, France.

ðŸšš We solve the __Pick-up and Delivery Problem__ with heteregeneous vehicles, and various complex constraints: time slots, capacities, breaks, limited parallel pick-up capacity... We implement our algorithms and integrate in the main software in Scala.

ðŸ“š I am currently learning about Machine Learning. My goal is to apply ML techniques at my current job, and to solve concrete problems.
